## Things I have done on this

-   Cycle animations and custom made components along with styling.
-   Simple NavBar that is reactive when on desktop
-   Responsive design
-   Layout Projects with *fluid* motions
-   Project Cards that expand with a cool animation! 
-   Image fallback from .webp to whatever other format is chosen.
-   Added a photos page that calls my flickr account to display pictures I have taken. :camera:
-   Infinite Scrolling on pictures (smaller payload on initial load)

## What I am working on.
-   More Content!
-   More Animations!
